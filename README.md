- Players soon discover that the perfect game ends in a tie no matter what the first player plays. It is usually young children who play tic tac toe: when they have discovered an unbeatable strategy, they move on to more sophisticated games, such as dots and boxes.
- The very simplicity of the game of tic tac toe makes it ideal as a pedagogical tool to teach the concepts of game theory and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the search for game trees.

## Rules
- Each player must only place their symbol once per turn and it must not be on an already played square. In case the player cheats, the winner will be the other. A straight or diagonal line must be achieved per symbol.
